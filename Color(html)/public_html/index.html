        <p style="background-color: rgba(255,92,72,1);text-align: center"><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release<br>
            of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing<br>
            software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
        <h3 style="font-family: serif;background-color:yellow;text-align: center ">Why do we use it?</h3>
        <p style="background-color: rgba(255,92,72,1);text-align: center">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the <br>
            readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using<br>
            Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,<br>
            as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable<br>
            English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum<br>
            as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites<br>
            still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, <br>
            sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
