        <h1><B>BATMAN</B></h1>
        <h3>A silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark knight.</h3>
        <p>Batman is a fictional comic character created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger.
          Batman first appeared in DC comics in the year 1939 and soon became popular.
          Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist,
          and owner of Wayne Enterprises. After witnessing the murder of his 
          parents Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne as a child, he swore vengeance against criminals,
          an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce Wayne trains himself physically and 
          intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime.
